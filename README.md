# PySpark-Case-Study-EDA-
Designed a recommender system to recommend recipes to users based on their choice and the current recipe they are looking at with PySpark. The recommendation engine is a way to increase the website's user engagement. If a user is shown relevant recipes, they are more likely to spend more time on your site reading about recipes.
